  "Sub: Guidance note - Board policy of the insurer on the commission structure \n\n1. This circular is issued in exercise of the powers conferred under Section 34 of\nthe Insurance Act,1938 and Section 14(2)(e) of the IRDAI Act, 1999 and\nRegulation 8 of the IRDAI (Payment of Commission) Regulations, 2023, \n2. As the “Insurance Agents, Intermediaries or Insurance Intermediaries” (herein\nafter referred to as intermediaries) play a crucial role in the distribution of\ninsurance products, it is essential for the insurers to have a clear and transparent\nboard policy on their commission structure to ensure fairness, transparency,\ncompliance, efficiency, and industry reputation in the insurance distribution\nprocess. \n3. The board policy on commission structures for intermediaries shall, at the\nminimum, include the following key elements: \ni) Objectives and Principles: The board policy shall clearly state the\nobjectives and principles that underpin the commission structure. This shall\ninclude promoting fair and transparent competition among intermediaries,\naligning incentives with customer needs, and encouraging efficient and costeffective distribution. \nii)Fairness and Reasonableness: The commission structure shall be\nreasonable and not result in excessive compensation for intermediaries at\nthe expense of customers or the insurer. Insurers shall ensure their\ncommission structure is commensurate with the efforts required to acquire\nand sustain that type of business. This means intermediaries shall be\ncompensated fairly for their work, regardless of their size or bargaining\npower.\n(iii)\nGood distribution practice: The Board policy on commission structure\nshall encourage good distribution practices of intermediaries. This can help\nenhance customer satisfaction, build a stronger relationship with the\ncustomers, increase the insurer's market share and ensure compliance with\nregulatory requirements.\n(iv) \nRegular review: The board policy shall establish a standard review process\nfor the commission structure, which includes assessments of its\neffectiveness, efficiency, impact on premium rates, benefit pay-outs,\npenetration, alignment with customer needs and interests etc. The review\nshall be conducted by the audit committee at least on an annual basis.\nv) Market Conduct: The board policy shall outline the governance and\noversight mechanism for market conduct to ensure that intermediaries\nadhere to high standards of behaviour and ethical practices. The board\npolicy shall recognise and address potential conflicts of interest due to the\ncommission structure, such as intermediaries recommending products not in\nthe customer's best interest to earn higher commissions. Furthermore, the\nboard may also put appropriate caps in absolute amounts in certain\nsegments, for example group products.\n(vi) Monitoring and Reporting: The board policy shall establish reporting\nrequirements for the commission structure, which includes regular reporting\nto the board of directors and senior management on the performance and\ncompliance of the commission structure.\n(vii) Applicability: Any new commission structure shall not apply to already sold\npolicies.",
  "Overall, the commission structure of intermediaries shall be designed to promote fair\nand transparent practices that protect policyholders' interests and encourage\ninsurance penetration."
