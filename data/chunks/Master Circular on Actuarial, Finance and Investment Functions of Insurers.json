An insurer carrying on the business of general insurance, health insurance, reinsurance shall comply with the requirements of Schedule II (Part II) of IRDAI (Actuarial, Finance and Investment Functions of Insurers) Regulations, 2024. Section 11 of the Insurance Act, 1938 requires all insurers to prepare at the expiration of each financial year, with reference to that year, a balance sheet, a profit and loss account, a separate account of receipts and payments, a revenue account in accordance with the regulations made by the Authority. 1.

Section II: Accounting and Disclosure Requirements 1. Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) Expenditure: The expenses incurred on CSR activities should not be charged to the Policyholders Account. In order to bring consistency, uniformity and fair presentation, expenditure towards Corporate Social Responsibility shall be shown in Profit and Loss Account. The insurer shall make disclosures as required under Companies Act 2013 read with rules / notification/circulars issued thereunder. Section III: Accounting and Disclosures specific to Life Insurers 1. Accounting of policies in force: As per the terms under which life insurance policies are issued, the policyholder has a grace period within which the premium is to be deposited as per the terms of the policy. This policy is followed throughout the accounting period, as also at the year end. Thus, premium on any policy which is in force as on 31st March, would be accrued if due and also within the specified grace period. For linked business, the due date for payment may be taken as the date when the associated units are created. Further, Section 13 of the Insurance Act, 1938 lays down the requirement for preparation of Actuarial Report and Abstract. The Regulations further provide for valuation of liabilities as on the valuation date, i.e., 31st March, every year. In view of the above, and as matter of regulatory prudence, it is reiterated that all insurers should finalize the financial statements for the year to which they pertain, taking into account the policies which are in force as on 31st March to ensure compliance with the requirements of the Act and the Regulations framed there under. 2. Recognition of Surplus arising in non-participating funds as profit in the Profit & Loss Account: It is clarified that the surplus arising in non-participating funds may be recognized as profit in the Profit and Loss account on quarterly basis provided that: / Page 160 / 270",
  "a. Financial statements are audited/ limited review by statutory auditor on quarterly basis, as applicable. b. The surplus to be transferred to Profit and Loss account must be certified and recommended by the Appointed Actuary of the company. c. A disclosure to this effect should be made in the financial statements. d. In any case, the amount transferred must not exceed the yearly profit. The difference, if any must be adjusted in the 4th quarter. In case the variation in the surplus is in excess of 10% or Rs.5 crores, whichever is higher, then the life Insurer shall submit to the Authority an explanation stating reasons for variation along with the annual financial statements. The explanation of variations so submitted shall be approved by the Board of Directors of life Insurers. 3. Declaration of Bonus: Section 49 of the Insurance Act, 1938 inter alia, provides that no life insurer shall declare bonus to the policyholders except out of a surplus shown in the valuation Balance Sheet which may arise as a result of actuarial valuation of the assets and liabilities of the insurer; nor shall he increase such surplus by contributions out of any reserve fund or otherwise unless such contributions have been brought in as revenue through the Revenue account on or before the valuation date. 3.1. Conditions to be met for declaration of bonus to the policyholders: An insurer intending to declare bonus, where the Participating Life Fund is in deficit, or when there is inadequate surplus, should strictly satisfy the conditions, as laid down by the Authority, hereunder: i) The Insurer shall make good the accumulated deficit in the Policyholders A/c and also transfer adequate assets to cover the cost of bonus, prior to declaration of bonus to the participating policyholders. Such transfer from the Shareholders A/c can be out of the Profit & Loss A/c balance or reserves in the Shareholders A/c, and/or by drawing upon the paid-up capital of the Insurer. By implication, there shall be no deficit in the Policyholders A/c in case of the insurer opting for declaration of bonus under these circumstances. ii) Any transfer as aforesaid, shall be by a debit to the Profit & Loss (Shareholders) Account and a credit to the Revenue (Policyholders) Account. iii) The funds so transferred to the Policyholders A/c shall be irreversible in nature, i.e., at no point of time can they be recouped to the Shareholders Account/ Fund. iv) The transfer to the Policyholders A/c must be fully backed by transfer of assets/investments to the Policyholder Funds, and should be adequate to meet the policyholders liabilities, including the cost of bonus. v) The proposed rates of bonus should be capable of being sustained over the future. / Page 161 / 270",
  "vi) The transfer of funds to the Policyholders A/c shall be supported by a special resolution of the shareholders at the general meeting of the insurer. Further, the Insurer shall appropriately increase the paid-up equity capital, within a period of six months from the date of transfer of funds, or such longer period as may be approved by the Authority, with a view to aligning the paid-up equity capital, such as to make up the deficiency (including the cost of bonus) in the life fund as aforesaid, and is backed up and represented by Policyholders assets/investments. The above provisions, for the purposes of meeting the requirement of declaration of bonus, are available to the insurers only during the first twelve financial years commencing from the year in which the life insurance business operations were started. Thereafter, it is expected that declaration of bonus will be supported by surplus within the life fund without recourse to contribution from the shareholders. 4. Disclosures relating to Discontinued Policies: 4.1. The Funds relating to the discontinued policies shall be shown under a separate head in the Balance Sheet under Policyholders Fund, alongside Policy Liabilities in the following manner: Funds for discontinued Policies: (i) Discontinued on account of non-payment of premiums (ii) Others 4.2.

Actuarial valuation of claims where claims period exceeds four years The Regulations require all insurers to furnish the particulars of the claims made in respect of contracts where the claims payment period exceeds four years. Such claims are required to be recognized on actuarial basis, for example payment arising out of long-term disability. In such cases, a certificate from an Appointed Actuary as to fairness of liability assessment must be obtained and the actuarial assumptions are required to be disclosed by way of Notes to the Accounts. It is further / Page 163 / 270",
  "clarified that the provisioning under this regulation has no relation to the time lag between the occurrence and settlement of a claim. 2. Alternate Risk Transfer Agreements (ART) Some of the non-life insurers are entering into Alternate Risk Transfer (ART) agreements as a substitute to/form of re-insurance. A broad assessment of the types of agreements being entered into by the insurers indicates that while at best these arrangements may be a combination of reinsurance and financing arrangements, in other instances ART may be purely in the nature of a financing agreement. Any ART arrangement has to be accounted for based on the principle of Substance over Form. If the agreement is in the nature of re-insurance coupled with financing arrangement, and the components are capable of separation, each element should be accounted for as per the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). However, in cases where the aforesaid components are not separable, the entire arrangement should be treated as a financial transaction and should be accounted for accordingly. All non-life insurers are required to account for the ART arrangements by looking into the Substance over Form, and account for the same as per the GAAP. 3. Segregation of Policyholders and Shareholders Funds: 3.1 Section 11 of the Insurance Act, 1938 mandates that every Insurer shall keep separate funds of shareholders and policyholders. In view of the said provision, general insurers including reinsurers, branch offices of foreign reinsurers, standalone health insurers and specialized insurers are advised as under: i.Bifurcate the policyholders and shareholders fund at the end of each quarter at the minimum at the fund level on notional basis. ii. Policyholders funds shall be the sum of: a) Estimated Liability for Outstanding claims including incurred but not reported (IBNR) and incurred but not enough reported (IBNER); b) Reserve for unearned premium reserve; c) Premium Deficiency, if any; d) Catastrophe Reserve, if any; and e) Other Liabilities net of Other Assets. Other Liabilities above, comprise of premium received in advance, unallocated premium, Balance due to other insurance companies, Due to other Members of a Pool such as Terrorism Pool, Sundry creditors (due to policyholders), etc. Other assets above, comprise of outstanding premium, due from other entities carrying on insurance business including Reinsurers, Balance with terrorism pool, if applicable, etc. / Page 164 / 270",
  "iii. Investments made out of the policyholders funds and shareholders funds shall be shown separately in the formats as specified. iv. As a result of the above, the Fair Value Change Account as it appears in the Balance Sheet shall accordingly stand bifurcated under the Shareholders fund and Policyholders fund. v. There shall not be any transfer from Policyholders Account to Shareholders Account on account of income/losses on investments vi. The income/ losses accrued / capital gains/losses on the investments are to be credited / debited to the respective Revenue Account and Profit & Loss Account, as the case may be. vii. All insurers shall ensure that the investments allocated to policyholders shall not be less than value of the policyholders fund. 3.2 Recoupment of the Deficit - Every Insurer shall ensure that the policyholders' fund as defined above, are fully supported by the policyholders' investments shown in Schedule- 8A. Therefore, any deficit / shortfall in policyholders' investments arising out of the loss in the Revenue Account or otherwise shall be recouped by transfer of securities from the shareholders' investments to the policyholders' investments on a half yearly basis. The valuation of such securities shall be in accordance with the valuation norms as specified in the regulations. 4. Transfer of securities to Policyholders Account from the Shareholders account or other wise Where securities are transferred to the policy holders Account, this should be at market price or amortized cost, whichever is lower. 5. Accounting treatment for Long Term products: A. Premium Recognition: Premium for a Long-Term policy if collected at the time of sale of the policy, for the entire Policy Duration or for any duration exceeding 12 months, shall be recognized on a yearly basis.

Applicable to reinsurers and the branch office of foreign reinsurers and Lloyds India Accounting of Premium, claims and related expenses on estimation basis: The Authority has carried out an analysis of the premium recognized by the FRBs and GIC Re and observed that while some of the FRBs are accounting for the premium on actual basis, some others are doing so on estimation basis. It is further observed that no uniform method / procedure has been followed by the reinsurers on accounting of the premium on estimation basis. The premium is accounted on estimation basis by the Reinsurer due to the following reasons: (i) lag or delay in receiving the statement of accounts from the Insurer(s); and/or (ii) alignment of accounting practices with parent organization. / Page 166 / 270",
  "Given that a significant part of the premium is being accounted on estimation basis, a need is felt to lay down guidelines to govern the accounting and disclosures of premium recognized on estimation basis in the annual report. Accordingly, the Authority lays down the following framework whereunder the FRBs/Reinsurers shall ensure that in annual financial statements no premium is accrued / accounted on estimate basis at least upto 3rd quarter of each financial year. However, for the fourth quarter ending on 31st March, where the statement of accounts has not been received in time, the premium, losses and related expenses may be accounted on estimation basis. However, in estimation of the said income and expenses, the reinsurers shall ensure that: a) a consistent methodology is followed across the entire portfolio; b) the estimates shall be trued up as actual values emerge; c) a statement shall be included in the annual report stating total premium, claims and expenses accounted for during the financial year and premium, claims and expenses accounted on estimation basis; d) complete disclosure shall be made for three years (including the current Financial Year) giving the segment wise break up of premium, claims and expenses accounted on estimation basis and its actual experience as per the attached formats Annexure XII and Managements comments on variation, if any, beyond 10% on a yearly basis under Notes to Accounts if the actual figures are available at the time of closing of books of accounts for the said financial year. In case of the information not being available, the above referred submissions shall be made in the annual report for the next financial year; and e) If the actual figures are not available at the time of closure of books of accounts for the financial year, any deviation beyond 10% shall be reported to the Authority in the format referred in above para 4 within 15 days from the end of first quarter of the next financial year. / Page 167 / 270\nSection VI: General 1) All insurers are advised to furnish the returns to the Authority as per the Regulations notified in this regard. In case there is no information applicable for a particular point the insurer should indicate Not Applicable or Nil, as the case may be, rather than deleting the said point from the Returns filed with the Authority. 2) The Regulations specify that certain points are required to be certified by a specified professional. The Insurer shall ensure that the Regulations are followed both in letter and spirit in the said context. It should be ensured that exceptions, if any, are brought out in the relevant certificate. Section VII: Deviation from specified Formats All insurers are hereby advised to strictly adhere to the formats (including schedules) specified by the Regulations and the directions issued thereunder by the Authority. Any new line item, if so warranted to be disclosed separately, may be shown under Others in Revenue Account, P&L Account and/or the relevant schedule of the financial statements, by giving the details of particulars of each item. / Page 168 / 270",

Expected policy premium income receivable on the Insurance Contracts which are already underwritten in Life and Pension & Annuity business in case of Life Insurers and General Insurance business in case of General Insurers. Page 212 of 270",
  "The overriding principle of any use of the above listed derivatives is that they must be used only for hedging to reduce interest rate risk. The Insurer should have a system to clearly track the Interest rate risk. To consider expected policy premium income for hedging, Insurers shall document and justify persistency assumptions as part of the hedge program development process. Assumption documentation and justification shall indicate the joint review and approval of both Appointed Actuary and CRO under the oversight of the Insurers Board (for example, via the Risk Management Committee/Asset Liability Management (ALM)Committee). D. Regulatory Exposure and Prudential Limits i. Counter parties shall necessarily be Commercial Banks and Primary Dealers (PDs) as permitted by RBI for FRAs and IRS. ii. Insurers dealing in FRAs and IRS have to arrive at the credit equivalent amount for the purposes of reckoning exposure to counter-party. For the purpose of exposure norms, Insurers shall compute their credit exposures, arising on account of Interest rate derivative transactions using the Current Exposure Method (CEM) as detailed below: The Credit Equivalent Amount of a market related off-balance sheet transaction calculated using the current exposure method is the sum of current credit exposure and potential future credit exposure of these contracts. Current credit exposure is defined as the sum of the gross positive mark-to-market value of these contracts. The Current Exposure Method requires periodical (at agreed periodicity) calculation of the current credit exposure by marking these contracts to market, thus capturing the current credit exposure. Potential future credit exposure is determined by multiplying the notional principal amount of each of these contracts irrespective of whether the contract has a zero, positive or negative mark-to-market value by the relevant add-on factor indicated below according to the nature and residual maturity of the instrument. Credit Conversion Factors Notional principal amount of each FRA/IRS shall be multiplied with the following conversion factor: Residual Maturity Conversion Factor per year One year or less 0.5 per cent Over One year to five year 1.0 per cent Over five years 3.0 per cent Page 213 of 270",
  "[Eg: If IRS of Rs. 10 crores with maturity of 4 years is entered into by the Insurance company with the counter party A, then the potential future credit exposure 10 x 3.5% Rs. 0.35crore (i.e. 3.5% 0.5% for First year 1% for next each year for 3 years as the duration is 4 years)] i. The Credit Equivalent Amount of the FRA/IRS shall be used for reckoning counter party credit exposure for the purposes of the Regulations as amended from time to time. ii. For exchange traded IRFs, the industry exposure limit is calculated against the Central Counter Party i.e. Clearing Corporation on the basis of above Credit Equivalent Amount. iii. Exposure limits pertaining to single Issuer, Group, Promoter Group and Industry will be applicable for the exposure through FRA and IRS contracts. Counter party rating shall be considered for calculating pattern of investments. The limits shall be reported in the remarks column of the respective quarterly returns. iv. A Participants dealing in Interest Rate derivatives under these guidelines shall in aggregate not exceed an outstanding notional principal amount equivalent to 100% of the book value of the fixed income investments of the Participant under the Policyholders Fund and the Shareholders Funds taken together. Life Insurers shall normally adhere to the 100% limits based on respective funds i.e. Life and P&A Fund. But where, in the case of Funds, the book value of the existing investments is lower than the expected premiums on the underwritten insurance contracts, the Insurer can utilize the exposure limit available in other funds within the overall 100% limit, provided the Board of the Insurer specifically approves, prior to entering into such derivative contract. The MTM gain/loss arising out of the effective hedge shall be borne by the respective fund only. v. If reinvestment of maturity proceeds of the existing investments/ interest income receivable on investments is hedged, such investments shall be held till maturity. If unavoidable need arises to liquidate instrument to meet the ALM, the hedge on such instrument has to be unwound simultaneously after obtaining specific approval from Investment Committee (IC). IC shall grant such approval after due recording of the reasons, provided the charges for unwinding the derivative contract is borne by the Shareholder. E. Insurers shall ensure all documentation requirements are completed in all aspects as per RBI guidelines and documentation prescribed by ISDA (International Swaps and Derivative Association).

Assets classifications: 1. Every insurer shall make adequate provision for estimated loss arising on account of under recovery of loans and advances (other than loans and advances granted against insurance policies issued by the insurer) outstanding at the balance sheet date. These guidelines are intended to provide the basis for determination of minimum provisions of loss on account of loans and advances. 2. Insurers shall classify their loans/advances into four categories, viz., (i) Standard Assets, (ii) Sub-Standard Assets, (iii) Doubtful Assets and (iv) Loss Assets. Classification of assets into these categories shall be done taking into account ability of the borrower to repay and the extent of value and realizability of security. 3. Standard Assets: Standard Asset is one which does not disclose any problem and which does not carry more than normal risk attached to the Business. Such an asset is not an NPA. The insurer should make a general provision on Standard Assets of a minimum of 0.40 per cent of the value of the asset. In respect of loans extended directly by insurers to sick units taken over by borrowers falling under the \"Standard\" classification, the facilities of the transferee and merged units may continue to be classified separately, for a period not exceeding 24 months from the date of the takeover of the sick unit, after which the performance of the loans Page 229 of 270",
  "charged to the insurers, it is necessary that insurers make adequate provisions against sub- standard assets, doubtful assets and loss assets, as per the procedure outlined below: i. Loss Assets: The entire asset should be written off. If the assets are to remain in the books for any reason, 100 per cent of the outstanding should be provided for. ii. Doubtful Assets: a) 100 percent provision of the extent to which the asset is not covered by the realizable value of the security to which the insurer has a valid recourse and the realizable value is estimated on a realistic basis. b) Over and above item (a) above, depending upon the period for which the asset has remained doubtful, 20% to 100% provision of the secured portion (i.e., estimated realizable value of the outstanding) should be made on the following basis: Period for which the Asset has been considered as % of Provision Doubtful Up to one year 20% One to three years 30% More than three years 100% iii. Sub-Standard Assets: A general provision of 10% of total value outstanding remaining substandard is required to be made including loans granted by the Central/State Government. In case of nursing finance granted by an insurer, the additional loan facilities sanctioned under the rehabilitation programme may be treated as a separate account and the performance assessed separately. Asset classification and provisioning in respect of such loan facilities as per the prescribed guidelines may be made only if the interest /principal payments remain due beyond 90 days. iv. Default in Repayment of Principal: On account of various reasons, such as delays in project implementation, getting adequate working capital facilities, etc., repayment of principal may be delayed beyond the stipulated one quarter. The asset may continue to be considered as standard if the installments of the principal amount are rescheduled with the approval of the Board of the concerned insurer. This is subject to the condition that the rescheduling can be done only once while the interest continues to be paid regularly. v. Time Overrun: In case of time overrun for completion of project directly financed by insurers, the Board of Insurer should decide based on valid grounds, whether the advance should be treated as standard asset. Page 231 of 270",
  "vi. One Time Settlement: Sometimes insurers enter into one time settlement (OTS) of their dues with a new owner. In cases where a sick unit has been merged with a healthy and strong unit and where payments are being made as per the OTS scheme, the asset in respect of the merged unit may be considered as standard without waiting for a period of 2 years for upgradation from sub-standard to standard asset. However, such cases should be approved by the Board of the concerned insurer. It is clarified that the said relaxation is allowed only in OTS cases. 8. In respect of loan facilities extended to sick units (under nursing programmes or otherwise) taken over by borrowers falling under the standard classification, the facilities of the transferee and the merged units may continue to be classified separately for a period not exceeding 2 years from the date of takeover of the sick unit, after which the performance of the loan facility sanctioned to the borrower as a whole should determine their classification. 9. Units enjoying more than one loan facility: In case of borrowers who have been granted more than one loan facility by the insurer, all the dues from them will have to be treated as NPAs if 50 per cent of its total interest and/or principal dues from all loans extended to it remain overdue for more than one quarter. 10. Government Guaranteed Loans: Loans or other credit facilities backed by Central/State Government guarantees should be treated on par with other assets for income recognition and provisioning. However, in respect of loans backed by Central Government guarantee, such loans shall be treated as NPA only when the Government repudiates its guarantee when invoked. 11. Income Recognition: Income in respect of any asset classified as NPA shall not be recognized unless realized. However, any adjustment towards overdue interest against any fresh/additional loan shall not be considered as realized. 12. Insurers are permitted to participate in Joint Lenders Forum (JLF), formed within RBI Guidelines for loan accounts which could turn into potential NPAs, and take up need based exposure with the prior approval of the Insurers Board, which could exceed exposure permitted under applicable Regulations. 13. The Insurer shall follow the latest RBI Circular / Guidelines issued on the above points, where the provisions of Master Circular, are inconsistent with respect to Point 3.7 of this Master Circular on Income Recognition, Asset Classification, Provisioning and Other related items.
